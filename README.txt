Pirate Inventory/ (Check In/Check Out) System


This will serve as an inventory system with the capability of checking in/out devices


There will be two sides
-admin
--This is where admins can add/edit inventoried items as well as log who has what devices and when they were checked out
--There will be a dash board of total Inventoried Items, and will be broken down by asset type, and then by count of said asset 
	-quantity of assets with percentange of the whole inventory 
	-devices checked out
		-checkout by who
	-most popular devices
		-determined by how many times an asset-type has been checked out
	-most damaged devices
		-determined by num of reports tied to it

-user side
--This is where the end user will check in/check out devices
--This will be a super simple interface so the end user can breeze through it
--When user signs in:
	--They can view checked out devices
	--limit the user if they have x amount of devices checked out
	--check in devices

--When user checks in or checks out device, it will be logged to a file so admins can see who had what and when
